- Brought down readability from 10 to 8 (wording, grammar, sentence length)
- Removed weasel words
- Changed structure, use more sub header for parts, easier to follow
- Added numbering order
- Moved explanations on top of code examples, to explain first what the code is doing, that is IMHO better for DX and stuff
- Unified the order in YAML examples
- Added more base info about k8 and Traefik to add more helpful value
- Moved reference YAML files out of docs and use 'pure' git. By doing so these can be tested with CI and having them in the docs adds no value
- Added link descriptions with fill explanations
- Rewrote content and reduced usage of admonitions
- Added more CI checks (GitHub actions)
- Added lefthook for pre-commit checks
- Adjusted and unified to use "you" with/in voice and tone, removed "we", since we is not always friendly and also not true, the user is following the tutorial and not we and the user
- Changes guide to tutorial, since it is a step-by-step walk-through tutorial, a guide would be more basic
- Make wording more friendly and welcoming, nothing is simple or easy :)
- Adjusted ordering of YAML files
- unify order in YAML examples, always kind, than api version
- Add more base info
- Make sure ful reference (00-YAML) uses the same order
- Put it online as a site, because a good UX/DX is not only the content but also the (visual) appearance

Wrote different versions and did user testing with both of them, changed and improved according to feedback, the process of getting feedback and working together is awesome.
Added more base information to make sure to meet the audience of experienced and newer people
Decided to rewrite existing docs (use them as base) to make sure to stay closer to the current style.
Starting new from scratch is usually easier
