- Brought down readability from 10 to 8 (wording, grammar, sentence length)
- Removed weasel words
- Changed structure, use more sub header for parts, easier to follow
- Added numbering order
- Moved explanations on top of code examples, to explain first what the code is doing, that is IMHO better for DX and stuff
- Unified the order in YAML examples
- Added more base info about k8 and Traefik to add more helpful value
- Moved reference YAML files out of docs and use 'pure' git. By doing so these can be tested with CI and having them in the docs adds no value
- Added link descriptions with fill explanations
- Rewrote content and reduced usage of admonitions
- Added more CI checks (GitHub actions)
- Added lefthook for pre-commit checks
